Evaluating programs utilizing LLMS and Generative Image Models using platform-independent tools

# 🤖 Generative AI- WandB: Evaluation and Debugging

In this repo, we'll evaluate programs utilizing LLMS and Generative Image Models using platform-independent tools, instrument a trainung notebook (add tracking, versioning, and logging), and implement monitoring/tracing of LLMs over time in complex interactions.

We'll use the Weights & Biases (WandB) to track experiments and run and version data. We'll have a semantic workflow to boost productivity.
